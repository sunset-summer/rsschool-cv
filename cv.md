**About me:** I've studied JS and React for some time, but it was more like a hobby, rather than something serious. Right now I'd like to get more experience and work as an JS-developer. My main goal is to learn as much as I can and to do something marvelous with all the tools that JS gives you.  
**Skills:** I have some experience with JS, Html, Css, React. But they're all on low-medium level.  
**Examples of code:** *Random piece of code I've found from my old React test field:*
```
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className='app-wrapper'>
      <Header />
      <Navbar />
      <Profile />
    </div>);
}
```


**Work experience:**  


**Education:** Odessa National Polytechnic University (Left in 2019)  


**Languages:** Native Russian and Ukrainian. C1-C2 English level. 3 years of work experience as an English language teacher.
