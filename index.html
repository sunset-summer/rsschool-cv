            <p>About me: I've studied JS and React for some time, but it was more like a hobby, rather than something serious. Right now I'd like to get more experience and work as an JS-developer. My main goal is to learn as much as I can and to do something marvelous with all the tools that JS gives you.</p>
            <p>Skills: I have some experience with JS, Html, Css, React. But they're all on low-medium level.</p>
            <p>Examples of code: Random piece of code I've found from my old React test field: <br />
            <q>
                <code>
                    const App = () => { <br />
                        return ( <br />
                            &ltdiv className='app-wrapper'&gt <br />
                            &ltHeader /&gt <br />
                            &ltNavbar /&gt <br />
                            &ltProfile /&gt <br />
                            &lt/div>);
                        }
