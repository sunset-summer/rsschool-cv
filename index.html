                About me: I've studied JS and React for some time, but it was more like a hobby, rather than something serious. Right now I'd like to get more experience and work as an JS-developer. My main goal is to learn as much as I can and to do something marvelous with all the tools that JS gives you.<br>
                Skills: I have some experience with JS, Html, Css, React. But they're all on low-medium level.<br>
                <h4>Examples of code:</h4><br>

                    return Array.from(new Set(a));<br>
                    }<br>
                <br>
